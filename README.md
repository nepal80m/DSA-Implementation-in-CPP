# **Implementation of Data Structure and Algorithms in C++**

In this repository, I have implemented some of the basic data structures and algorithms in C++ language.  
Some of the concepts that I have covered here are:
* [**Stack**](./Stack/)
     * Operations in a Stack (Push / Pop)
     * Application of Stacks
       * Infix to Postfix conversion

* [**Queue**](./Queue/)
     * Linear Queue
       * Operations (Enqueue/ Dequeue)
     * Circular Queue
       * Operations (Enqueue/ Dequeue)
* [**Linked List**](./LinkedList/)
     * Singly Linked List
       * Insertion at Beginning
       * Insertion at End
       * Insertion at Any Index
       * Deletion at Beginning
       * Deletion at End
       * Deletion at Any Index
       * Display

     * Doubly Linked List
       * Insertion at Beginning
       * Insertion at End
       * Insertion at Any Index
       * Deletion at Beginning
       * Deletion at End
       * Deletion at Any Index
       * Display
